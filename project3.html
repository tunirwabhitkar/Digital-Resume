            <p>Talk-A-Tive is a full-stack chatting application designed to facilitate real-time communication between users. The app leverages Socket.io for real-time messaging and MongoDB for securely storing user details in an encrypted format. The project includes both a client-side and a server-side component, developed with modern technologies to ensure a robust and responsive chat experience.</p>
            
            <p>The application utilizes React JS for the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. The backend is built with Node JS and Express JS, handling user authentication, message routing, and real-time updates. To run the application locally, clone the repository from GitHub, install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend, and start the server and client. This setup allows for seamless real-time communication and secure user data management.</p>
